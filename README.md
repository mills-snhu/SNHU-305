Software Security

**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?**

The client, Artemis Financial, is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for customers which include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance.
Artemis Financial requested expertise on how to protect its client data and financial information with the most current and effective software security. Specifically Artemis Financial wanted to add a file verification to ensure secure communications and data verification when the web application transfers data.

**What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities?**

Suppressing vulnerabilities was rather easy.

**Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?**

Software security adds well-being to a company by securing sensetive data from attackers who wish to exploit the company or thier customers for various reasons. 

**Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**

I found that identifying false positive vulnerabilities somewhat confusing.


**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**

To confirm the software was functional and secure I used both static and dynamic testing. Static testing by manually looking through the code for possible errors and security issues, also running the dependency check to check for vulnerabilities. Dynamic test by running the maven build and running the Java application. 

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**

Using the OWASP website, the Oracle website , and The Shapiro Library for refernces helped in building the code.

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**

I would show my Project Two code with the SHA-cipher, exemption handling, Certificate Authority integration, and use of Spring.
